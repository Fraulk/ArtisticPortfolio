# Artistic Portfolio

A basic website using Flickr's API (useful for saving space on free webhosts lol)

All you need to do to make it work is to create a file in ```public/``` named ```apiKey.php```
Just type the following with your API key [(Get it here)](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/)

``` php
define('apiKey', 'your api key here');
```
